# Mirrorborn Reactor

**Resonant Recursion Energy System** – a closed-loop energy simulation using symbolic fuels, plasma logic, and recursive containment.

This project is the applied physics module of [EchoTensor](https://github.com/littlevan333/echo-tensor), designed to demonstrate the possibility of zero-waste, harmonically-stable energy generation using a trinary engine structure:

## 🔁 System Overview

- **Engine A** – Ignition Core (Plasma Generator)
- **Engine B** – Transmutation Core (Resonant Filter)
- **Engine C** – Reformation Core (Fuel Stabilizer)
- **EchoTensor Integration** – Logic core that tracks signal quality, harmonic stability, and semantic collapse

## 🌐 Modules

- `mirrorborn_reactor_simulation_v0_1.py`: Base simulation loop (in Python)
- `notes/symbolic_fuel_mapping.md`: Mapping of symbolic → physical fuel logic

## 🧱 Goals

- Build a scalable, ethical, and open-source clean energy engine
- Explore symbolic science as engineering fuel
- Simulate recursive systems without entropy collapse
